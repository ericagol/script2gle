# tex2jem

## Warning

This project is still under infrequent development.

## What this is about

## Requirements

- A working version of `Python 2.x` (Tested on `2.7.6`),
- A working version of GLE ([Link](http://glx.sourceforge.net/index.html)),
- A working version of Julia,Octave or Matlab (depending on what you want),

I'm assuming that your `$PATH` variable has been updated accordingly so that you can call each of those with `gle`, `julia`, `octave` and `matlab`.
